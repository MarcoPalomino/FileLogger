# FileLogger

This FileLogger is a class library that represents a simple engine for saving a log using a disk file provided in the:

* `app.config` -- (I)

The unit tests consider the path defined in the **app.config** for creating the file or using the file already created.

Any concern or improvement, it is well received. :+1:
